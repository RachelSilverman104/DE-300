Open the file in your workspace and run each code block sequentially. All data and packages needed to run the sections are embedded in the code.
If issues are encountered, the packages being imported may need to be installed. The code assumes all packages used have already been installed.

Question 1:
  * The first table displays the raw data with the document id and all words in the document in an array
  * The second table shows each appearance of each word along with the document id of the document it appears in
  * The third table shows the document id, word, and the number of times it appears in that document
  * The fourth table shows the document id and the number of words contained in that document
  * The fifth table shows all words contained within the data and the number of documents that they appear in
  * The sixth table combines all of the above data. It displays the word, the document it appears in, the number of times it appears in said document, the number of words in said document, and the number of documents total in which the word appears
  * The next output shows the first 5 rows of the RDD and the data contained within each row
  * The next output shows the number of documents in the data
  * The last output shows the document id and all words contained within the document along with their tfidf score for the first 5 documents in the data

Question 2:
  * The first output displays the value of the loss function for the given data
  * The second output displays the first 15 predictions for the data using the svm classifier
